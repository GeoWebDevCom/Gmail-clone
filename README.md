Gmail-clone
=========

## About ##


You can see it working [here](https://gmail-clone.herokuapp.com/) as well.
Login/pass - admin@admin.com/admin

## Requirements ##

- npm, node, bower, gulp
- desirable to install json-server globally (npm i -g json-server)
- Passion about programming and clear mind;)

## Quick Start ##

1. First clone the repository
2. Then set the config files appropriate to your local settings and your personal preferences (currently you'll probably need to change only port for Express)
3. npm i
4. bower i
5. npm start and serve data via express routes and configs

    OR

6. simply start 'json-server db.json' to emulate DB data and go to src/client folder and launch any server from there (i'm personally prefer live-server - npm i -g live-server, you can also use 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer')


## Details ##



## Config ##
Currently I have several configs in src/server folder, in app.js (root) and in app.module/app.routes (src/client)
Later I'll probably optimize it.
